Set your ISP DNS settings, in the router to:  
<del><code>176.103.130.130</code></del> <code>94.140.14.14</code>  
<del><code>176.103.130.131</code></del> <code>94.140.15.15</code>  

it blocks ads, banners, malicious-websites-access to all of your home-network,  
it does not block access to adult-related websites for that you can Google search for the family-friendly DNS addresses of AdGuard.

On other cases you'll find a DNS section in the "advanced" section.

You may set the DNS for a single device,  
for example on your phone, when you are using internet-connection from your mobile-service provider.  

Putting a custom DNS on your device when you are connected to your home-network is not advisable,  
since you won't be able to "see" other devices on your network (printers, other devices, IP cameras, etc..).
